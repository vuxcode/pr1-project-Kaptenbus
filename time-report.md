  - *Wrote a "code" which make the user input in the changeOrder prompt failproof*
  - *Testing the code in different ways ended up finding a error*
  - *Tried fixing an error that i got from my "failproof code" with different type of if-statments and position of code etc, have not been able to solve it yet but clearly need to have it inside an statement i belive. But the code works as i wanted*
  - *Added so the changeOrder function now when you are done "send" the order to the shopping cart once again*

- 2022-04-15 16:00 Worked for 2 hours.

  - *Changed my pricing idea to each menu have a different price, not every item*
  - *Adding the pricing so that the user see what the items cost*

  - *Added a loop which work as a total cost of the items the user pick (in the Shopping cart)*
  - *Added so when the user wants to remove an item it also remove the cost of that item (took a while to figure that out)*
