Thought about making the "shopping cart" after the first menuFunction but will do it after the secound, so i can solve any problems that may occur with not only one menu but two. Will make the troubleshooting easier and no more problems SHOULD occur when adding the third menuFunction.

Menu functions take less time then planned, i belive my idea was was to "clear" in my head making the coding faster. Which also results in less problems.
(So far)

Made the shopping cart function, can't find a way to get rid of the arrays "," in the user output. Shopping function would look better without it, buggs me. Function works great, no problems with the menu orders so far. Made an additional array to store the old cart, could possibly make a new button that could delete unwanted objects (just an idea).

Note to self: Don't forget to commit the changes, while testing etc.

Still going faster then expected, i belive i will continue as planned and when the program is finished i will try to make the extra features.

Orignal idea complete, started the changeOrder feature. Had problems with my arrays since i push([index] + "\n") which result in an array that looks like ["Pepsi,\n"].
Causing trouble with the array to interact with an if-statement and also made my splice function to remove the wrong array.

Need to rework the push functions on the other menu's and need to find a new way for my shopping cart to look. (since the function work)
